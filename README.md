## before-install
* Do a backup of your settings.json file.

## deps
* Fira Code font (downloadable on Google Fonts).

## howto-install
Open Windows Terminal and go to Settings tab (You can also press `ctrl+,`). Click on "Open JSON file".
Replace it with the "settings.json" repository file. **IMPORTANT!** In the settings.json, change `<BACKGROUND PATH>` for your preferred background.

Relaunch your terminal and now you have your theme!

## uninstall
If you made a copy of your "settings.json", you can return to your old settings using the backup. If you did not made a backup, try to undo the changes. In the worst times, you must reinstall Windows Terminal.
